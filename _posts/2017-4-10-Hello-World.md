title: The Data Science Seeds
---

I started my professional career as a journalist. It didn’t last long. After a few short internships right after college, I turned left -- quite literally -- and spent several years touring the country playing drums in a rock band. 

Before I recently made a career change and enrolled in a full-time data science boot camp at [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com), I spent some time reflecting on my journalism days. 

That is when, I believe, the data science seeds were planted. 

Trite but relevant, journalism is about the search for truth. More importantly, it is about finding patterns in data, synthesizing different sources, and telling meaningful stories. 

To me, that’s data science.

When I was an undergraduate, I worked on a story for my college newspaper about the university’s employment of long-term, but “temporary” employees (temporary employees cost organizations less because they are not paid benefits). 

I tracked down one university employee who had worked under the “temporary” classification for so long he could not remember his start date. He worked mostly as a janitor and his requests for permanent positions were repeatedly turned down by upper administrators.

The university would not confirm the employee’s start date and filing a Freedom of Information Act (I went to a publicly tax-funded university) request would have taken too long. I eventually resorted to manually flipping through stacks of old, dusty, payroll books stored in the basement of the campus’ largest library. 

The employee’s first year of entry in the logbooks: 1988. He had been a “temporary” employee for 15 years. 

After interviewing a few more permanent temporary employees of the university, I typed up the article and [we went to print.][1] 

Reflecting on this experience, I try to imagine what a data scientist could uncover about the university’s over-reliance on long-term temp workers. How many are there? What jobs do they do? What is their demographic profile? 

A few years ago, ProPublica examined temp workers nationwide. Through a logistic regression analysis of BLS and occupational data, [ProPublica revealed][2] that the rate of injury on the job for temp workers is 36 percent to 72 percent higher than non-temp workers.

It is work like that which has inspired me to become a data scientist. 

Quality data science, like quality journalism, has the power to shape shape laws, hold government policies accountable and influence corporate decisions. As my career in data science expands, I am excited to tap into my “inner-journalist” -- explore public data sets that may reveal undiscovered patterns within our civic institutions and bring to life stories that have real meaning.
